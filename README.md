## Overview
In an attempt to analyze the NYC Citi Bike service and determine the feasibility of establishing a similar service in Des Moins, the following analysis has been conducted on the user base and hours of operation of the Citi Bike service in NYC.
## Results
The following spheres of analysis are carried out (in order in Tableau):
- Hours during which bikes are checked out
- Hours during which bikes are checked out (by gender)
- Heatmap of when trips are started based on weekday
- Heatmap of when trips are started based on weekday (by gender)
- Heatmaps of single-time customers vs. Citi Bike subscribers (by gender)
- The starting locations of Citi Bike rentals, organized by number of rentals, and 
- The stopping locations of Citi Bike rentals, organized by number of rentals
## Summary
The analysis shows that the Citi Bike service is used primarily by repeat-subscriber customers to commute to and from work on weekdays, followed by single-use customers who use Citi Bike rentals to get around on the weekend. This shows a varied and sustainable consumer base who will use the service both during regular buisness days, as well as on holidays and abnormal days. 

To further study the viability of implementing this service in Des Moins, it is recommended to commission an analysis of bike longetivity based on number of uses of an individual bike, and an analysis of repair costs when compared to the operational profit of individual bikes.
